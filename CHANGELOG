0.3.0
	Integrate bugfix from Tom Ritter to fix bad Message Sending bug. Previously,
		as the server ran, all messages would be delivered to all recipients
		that had been seen so far.
	Fix Header Field processing that would badly mess up messages with no 
		headers

	Process Quicksilver Messages, which are formatted in a way inconsistent
		with the Mixmaster spec.  See mixPayload.py
	Process remailer-adminkey
	Process detination-block requests and do not send mail to them.
		WARNING: The detination-block file writing is not thread-safe
	Better prompts in setup.py, allow admin and abuse addresses to be addresses	
		on other domains.  Try to get adminkey from keyring.
	
	Add stubs for remailer-stats and remailer-conf
	Stubs/Rearchitecting for downloading stats programmatically
	Improve logging by outputing message UID with each line
0.2.1

	Change app name to mixmaster-faster because mixmaster expects to only
		recieve messages from itself
