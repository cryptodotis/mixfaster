TODO

 - Way More of REMAIL
 - replace templates/help.msg with something not stolen from dizum, 
   and update it
 - figure out a way to refresh mlist.txt, rlist.txt and pubring.{mix,asc} 
 - Let setup.py be rerun without having to git checkout the modified files
 - In mixKey.decode we assume a version of 2 if it's not provided. This is...
   probably ok.
 - mixKey.decode doesn't know the difference between CNm and CNp modes in the
   pubring.mix string.  Neither does the author.
 - In mixKeystore loadKeyRing there's an inconsistency where if we load a 
   private key but never the public key we don't have the shortname and other 
   properties. It'd be nice to throw an exception on access of those in that 
   case...
 - mixconfig.getCapString may not be accurate
 - Can't have a single quote in your passphrase for the key.
 - Untested Structure Sections:
        PacketType.FinalHopPartialMessage
        UserDataType.Gzip
        UserDataType.Email
 - Tons of Unimplemented Features:
        Pool Delays
        Partial Messages / Message Fragments
        Parsing Dummy Messages
        Posting to Newsgroups
        Duplicate Mail Detection (Sending duplicates is a feature of mixmaster
            that should be supported, not an error condition to be checked.)
        Blocked Addresses
        Doesn't reply with an explanation if it recieves a non-mix email
 - Ensure remailer talks TLS over the SMTP links whenever possible
 - Normalize logging. Make it a option chosen on setup
     NSA logging - log all messages in and out
     Debug logging - log messages that cause errors
     Minimal logging - log almost nothing
 - Right now any message with a destination of null: gets ignored. No one
   would mix a legit and a dummer recipient together... right?
 - lamson has very, very rudimentary support for skipping over .onion MX records
   (because of frell).  It'd be nice to fully support delivering to .onion
        
LONG TERM REMAILER REFRESHES

These will break older mixes. They should only be done if there are serious 
advantages of keeping the old protocol mostly-intact instead of moving to a
standard encrypted-wire-protocol of OpenPGP

 - Newer Cryptographic Algorithms
    RSA 2048 or ECC instead of RSA 1024
    AES-256 instead of TDES

 - Update its assumption that it is the only mixmaster implementation
   rem.c : 175 : bufileft(content, "mixmaster")
